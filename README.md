#  Notepad

Notepad is an simple android application built during the #DSC20DaysOfCode organised by Unilag Developer Students Group [DSCUnilag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DSCUnilag).

As a participant of the program, my knowledge about parts of android architecture namely: live data, room, work manager and view model were reinforced

Notepad, allows its user to create, read, edit and delete notes.

At this point, I had completed the tasks of put out by the program, but then, no work of technology is completely finished. I'll be working on my own improvements to it in later days.
Please find a link to the apk [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D1_wB5XIqK83zWLe09jSjBolhFwN7PcN/view?usp=sharing). Just click the download button when you're there. Install and enjoy!
